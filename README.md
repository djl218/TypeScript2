# Patientor Backend

This is the backend code for the Patientor app.  An app that uses TypeScript to manage patient data.

The state management is built using React Hooks `useContext` and `useReducer`.  The styling is done with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for navigation.  Also [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) is used for form handling.

<h3>TypeScript features in this app:</h3>

* Utility types
* Union types
* Exhaustive type checking
* Interfaces
* Configuration rule: `noImplicitAny`
* `@typescript-eslint`
* React components with TypeScript
* TypeScript modules

<h3>Benefits of using TypeScript:</h3>

* Type checking
* Static code analysis
* Type annotations act as code level documentation
* Smarter intellisense
* Prevention of passing extra/unwanted props to components
* Ensures that required props are passed to components
* Guarantees that only props of correct types are passed to components
